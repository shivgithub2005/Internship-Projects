## This project focuses on analyzing customer feedback data to extract meaningful insights that can drive better decision-making and improve customer satisfaction.

🔄 Workflow Summary:
Data Import:

        Customer feedback data is originally stored in an Excel file. 
        The data is imported into a PostgreSQL database for structured storage and efficient querying.
          
Data Analysis:
    Using SQL and Python in a Jupyter Notebook, various basic analyses are performed on the data, such as:

        Summary statistics
        Feedback categorization
        Sentiment overview
        Trend identification

Visualization:
    A Power BI dashboard is created to present the key findings in a visually interactive and insightful manner. This includes:

        Sentiment distribution
        Common issues/keywords
        Ratings trends
        Feedback over time

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:

        Excel – Source file for raw customer feedback
        PostgreSQL – For storing and querying structured data
        SQL – For data extraction and transformation
        Python (Jupyter Notebook) – For analysis and preprocessing
